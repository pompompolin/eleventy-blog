<h1>Hello World! It's a blog!</h1>
<p>I finally decided to create a blog on my journey to learn how to code.</p>
<p>My goal is to document my major discoveries and to motivate me to go deaper into some specific subjects. I will try to post twice a month.</p>
<p>To create the blog, I used the static site generator Eleventy. There is still some work to do, it's absolutely not perfect but we will make it shine over time!</p>
